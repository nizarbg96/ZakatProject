        <p>When a person misses a payment of Zakat, the outstanding balance becomes a debt. A Zakat debt is more severe than normal debts. A normal debt is the right of the creditor who may be wealthy and affluent. Whereas, a Zakat debt has two rights attached to it; not only is it the right of a needy person, in addition, it is the right of Allah that one pays his Zakat.</p>
